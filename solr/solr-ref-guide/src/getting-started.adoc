Solr makes it easy for programmers to develop sophisticated, high-performance search applications with advanced features such as faceting (arranging search results in columns with numerical counts of key terms).

Solr builds on Lucene, an open source Java library that provides indexing and search technology, as well as spellchecking, hit highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities. Both Solr and Lucene are managed by the Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/[www.apache.org)].

This section introduces you to the basic Solr architecture and features to help you get up and running quickly. It covers the following topics:

<<a-quick-overview.adoc#a-quick-overview,A Quick Overview>>: A high-level overview of how Solr works.

<<installing-solr.adoc#installing-solr,Installing Solr>>: A walkthrough of the Solr installation process.

<<solr-configuration-files.adoc#solr-configuration-files,Solr Configuration Files>>: Overview of the installation layout and major configuration files.

<<running-solr.adoc#running-solr,Running Solr>>: An introduction to running Solr. Includes information on starting up the servers, adding documents, and running queries.

<<taking-solr-to-production.adoc#taking-solr-to-production,Taking Solr to Production>>
