This section exposes potential techniques which can be used for searching deeply nested documents,
show casing how more complex queries can be constructed using some of Solr's query parsers and Doc Transformers.
These features require `\_root_` and `\_nest_path_` to be declared in the schema. +
Please refer to the <<indexing-nested-documents.adoc#indexing-nested-documents, Indexing Nested Documents>>
section for more details about schema and index configuration.


[NOTE]
This section does not show case faceting on nested documents. For nested document faceting, please refer to the
<<json-facet-api#uniqueblock-and-block-join-counts, Block Join Facet Counts>> section.

== Query Examples

For the upcoming examples, we'll assume an index containing the same documents covered in <<indexing-nested-documents#example-indexing-syntax,Indexing Nested Documents>>:

include::indexing-nested-documents.adoc[tag=sample-indexing-deeply-nested-documents]

=== Child Doc Transformer

By default, documents that match a query do not include any of thir nested children in the response.  The `[child]` Doc Transformer Can be used enrich query results with the documents' descendants.

For a detailed explanation of this transformer, and specifics on it's syntax & limitations, please refer to the section <<transforming-result-documents.adoc#child-childdoctransformerfactory, [child] - ChildDocTransformerFactory>>.

A simple query matching all documents with a description that includes "staplers":

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select?omitHeader=true&q=description_t:staplers'
{
  "response":{"numFound":1,"start":0,"maxScore":0.30136836,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!prod",
        "name_s":"Swingline Stapler",
        "description_t":"The Cadillac of office staplers ...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200}]
  }}
----

The same query with the addition of the `[child]` transformer is showm below.  Note that the `numFound` has not changed, we are still matching the same set of documents, but when returning those documents the nested children are also returned as psuedo-fields.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select?omitHeader=true&q=description_t:staplers&fl=*,[child]'
{
  "response":{"numFound":1,"start":0,"maxScore":0.30136836,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!prod",
        "name_s":"Swingline Stapler",
        "description_t":"The Cadillac of office staplers ...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200,
        "skus":[
          {
            "id":"P11!S21",
            "color_s":"RED",
            "price_i":42,
            "_version_":1672933224035123200,
            "docs":[
              {
                "id":"P11!D41",
                "name_s":"Red Swingline Brochure",
                "content_t":"...",
                "_version_":1672933224035123200}]},
          
          {
            "id":"P11!S31",
            "color_s":"BLACK",
            "price_i":3,
            "_version_":1672933224035123200}],
        "docs":[
          {
            "id":"P11!D51",
            "name_s":"Quick Reference Guide",
            "content_t":"How to use your stapler ...",
            "_version_":1672933224035123200},
          
          {
            "id":"P11!D61",
            "name_s":"Warranty Details",
            "content_t":"... lifetime garuntee ...",
            "_version_":1672933224035123200}]}]
  }}

=== Child Query Parser

The `{!child}` query parser can be used to search for the _descendent_ documents of parent documents matching a wrapped query. For a detailed explanation of this parser, see the section <<other-parsers.adoc#block-join-children-query-parser, Block Join Children Query Parser>>.

Let's consider again the `description_t:staplers` query used above -- if we wrap that query in a `{!child}` query parser then instead of "matching" & returning the product level documents, we instead match all of the _descendent_ child documents of the original query:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl --globoff 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select?omitHeader=true&q={!child+of="*:*+-_nest_path_:*"}description_t:staplers'
{
  "response":{"numFound":5,"start":0,"maxScore":0.30136836,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!D41",
        "name_s":"Red Swingline Brochure",
        "content_t":"...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P11!S21",
        "color_s":"RED",
        "price_i":42,
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P11!S31",
        "color_s":"BLACK",
        "price_i":3,
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P11!D51",
        "name_s":"Quick Reference Guide",
        "content_t":"How to use your stapler ...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P11!D61",
        "name_s":"Warranty Details",
        "content_t":"... lifetime garuntee ...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200}]
  }}
----

NOTE: The `of` local param is neccessary to tell the `{!child} parser the set of _all_ "parent" documents to consider when looking for matching children.  In this example we've used `\*:* -\_nest_path_:*` to indicate we want to consider all documents which don't have a nest path field -- ie: all "root" level document.

=== Parent Query Parser

The inverse of the `{!child}` query parser is the `{!parent}` query parser, which let's you search for the _ancestor_ documents of some child documents matching a wrapped query.  For a detailed explanation of this parser, see the section <<other-parsers.adoc#block-join-parent-query-parser,Block Join Parent Query Parser>>.

Let's first consider this example of searching for all "sku" type documents that have a color of "RED"...

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select?omitHeader=true&q=color_s:RED'
{
  "response":{"numFound":2,"start":0,"maxScore":0.2449984,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!S21",
        "color_s":"RED",
        "price_i":42,
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P22!S22",
        "color_s":"RED",
        "price_i":89,
        "_version_":1672933224436727808}]
  }}
----

We can wrap that query in a `{!parent}` query to return the details of all products that have "RED" skus...

[source,bash]
----
$ curl --globoff 'http://localhost:8983/solr/gettingstarted/select?omitHeader=true&q={!parent+which="*:*+-_nest_path_:*"}color_s:RED'
{
  "response":{"numFound":2,"start":0,"maxScore":1.4E-45,"numFoundExact":true,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"P11!prod",
        "name_s":"Swingline Stapler",
        "description_t":"The Cadillac of office staplers ...",
        "_version_":1672933224035123200},
      {
        "id":"P22!prod",
        "name_s":"Mont Blanc Fountain Pen",
        "description_t":"A Premium Writing Instrument ...",
        "_version_":1672933224436727808}]
  }}
----


NOTE: The `which` local param of the `{!parent} parser serves the same purpse as the `{!child}` parser's `of` param: to define the set of _all_ "parent" documents to consider for matching based on thier children.  In this example we've again used `\*:* -\_nest_path_:*` to indicate we want to consider all documents which don't have a nest path field -- ie: all "root" level document.



=== Combining Block Join Query Parsers with Child Doc Transformer

The combination of these two parsers with the `[child] transformer enables seamless creation of very powerful queries.

Here for example is a query where:

* the (sku) documents returned must have a color of "RED"
* the (sku) docments returned must be the descendents of root level (product) documents which have:
** immediate child "docs" documents which have:
*** "lifetime garuntee" in their content
* each return (sku) document also includes any descendent (docs) documents it has

[source,bash]

  }}
